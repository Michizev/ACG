# Notes
- We load and render an [obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) file.
- We use [nuget](https://github.com/chrisjansson/ObjLoader).
- Unused attributes/uniforms give a location of `-1`.


# To do
1. Add mesh attributes to `vertexArray`.
1. Make the model fit inside the view-port and rotate it around the y-axis.
1. Load another obj file (only triangulated models)
